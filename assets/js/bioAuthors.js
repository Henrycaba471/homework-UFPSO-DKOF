<p class="bio">John Katzenbach’s career as a novelist began in 1982, with the publication of In The Heat of the Summer, an edgy crime novel that examined the cult of celebrity, fame and media ethics. A Book of the Month Club selection, this novel showed the newspaper industry at its height, and at the beginnings of its slide — and elected many of his experiences as a crime and courthouse reporter for both the Miami Herald and the now defunct Miami News. This novel was filmed as The Mean Season with Kurt Russell and Mariel Hemingway.<br><br> Since the publication of that first novel, John Katzenbach has written 12 other psychological thrillers and one acclaimed non-fiction book. Published in dozens of languages throughout the world, his novels have been on bestseller lists from Bonn to Buenos Aires. He has received awards in France, Germany and the United States. Three of his other novels have been filmed: Just Cause with Sean Connery and Laurence Fishburne in 1995; Hart’s War with Colin Farrell and Bruce Willis in 2002; and a French version of The Wrong Man — shown on France 2 Television as Faux Coupable. Two other novels — the international bestseller The Analyst and the award-winning bestseller The Madman’s Tale are currently in development with shooting dates in 2015.<br><br>His latest book — The Dead Student— is scheduled for publication by Grove/Atlantic/Mysterious Press in the fall of 2015, and simultaneously by Head of Zeus Publishing in Great Britain. <br><br>First thing to know: He hates middle age. <br><br>Actually, didn’t care all that much for being young either, where he was the in-between type of child that didn’t get listened to very much. Teenage was filled with existential readings and prep school angst, unrequited love and unrealized lust. That part was fairly normal. He had a reputation (deserved) as something of a long haired rebel and he takes considerable pride in having established new standards for academic and disciplinary restrictions and probation during his years at The Phillips Exeter Academy. Takes even greater credit for helping to create the school’s 9th Rule. That is, when he arrived at that cold, ivy-covered and unfriendly place in the 1960s, there were eight existing rules that could get you kicked out. He, along with two others (one who became a nationally-renowned internist and another a well-known and popular teacher) got busted by school authorities engaging in a practice that was clearly a violation of something – although, at that time, there wasn’t a clear-cut and well-defined rule against it. Suffice it to say it had something to do with significantly altered mental states. So, without the necessary rule to give school officials the sort of petty quasi-legal support they needed – they couldn’t kick him and his friends out. This might have been his first lesson in unintended irony. <br><br>Graduated just barely and went to Bard College, where he learned everything a young writer needs to know from incredible teachers – like Robert Rockman, Peter Sourian, Justus Rosenberg and the late Elisabeth Stambler and Mary Lee Settle — and wildly creative classmates. A wonderful place in the late 60s, filled with unbridled energy and fervent revolution. It remains so today, although probably less emphasis is placed on the revolution part. Had the opportunity while at Bard to occasionally yell at the two guys down the hall to turn their music down, which they usually did, being fundamentally nice fellows. They went on to some success as the rock group Steely Dan. <br><br></p>

<p>Followed college with an aborted trip to Iowa to inspect the creative writing program, where he realized that he didn’t have anything to write about except being young and wanting to write, which didn’t seem like particularly compelling subject matter. This translated into taking a job on the night city desk of the Trenton Times in Trenton, New Jersey (at the princely salary of $110 @ week). Trenton is famous for many things, not the least of which is a railroad sign above the Delaware River bridge, which states: Trenton Makes, the World Takes. One of Trenton’s main industries at the time was manufacturing condoms. There had to be some connection. Anyway, he stayed at the Trenton paper for three years, covering everything from town meetings concerned with leash laws to bloody prison riots, mental hospitals to murders until an unfortunate falling out with an editor resulted in him being summarily fired. At the time and despite numerous Page One stories, the editor informed him: “The only thing you are capable of writing is the weather ear….” That’s the little forecast that adorns the upper right hand corner on the front page – Cloudy Today, Sunny Tomorrow. He thinks he has successfully proven that particular editor to be mistaken. <br><br>Anyway, went from there to the (late and lamented) Miami News, where he covered crime and punishment. Won some awards. Gained some notoriety for his reporting. Quit to write his first novel In The Heat of the Summer, which became a Book-of-the-Month Club selection, a bestseller published in nearly 20 countries and the movie The Mean Season. Returned to the Miami Herald, where he also covered crime and punishment with similar distinction. It was, parenthetically, a wonderful time to be a reporter in Miami. Everything that could go wrong did. Everything that could be bizarre was. And everything that might be outrageous, well, outraged <br><br>Followed up his novel with his only non-fiction book, First Born – a Literary Guild selection. After that, he devoted himself to fiction. Two of his other books have been filmed – Just Cause and Hart’s War. Three others are currently in “development” which means that if all the chips fall properly, they will some day land on the big screen. Finally left newspapers in 1987 after publishing the New York Times bestseller The Traveler – a favorite of thriller buffs worldwide and the occasional serial killer. Although no longer a reporter, he still longs for the wonderful sensation of excitement that accompanies pursuing a big story. Now lives in humdrum Western Massachusetts, an incredibly reasonable place except in the winter (which sometimes seems like half the year). Published all over the world, received many awards. Married to the writer/journalist/professor Madeleine Blais, whom he met in Trenton. Two children neither of who wants to work in anything other than the Arts, despite his oft-spoken pleas to the contrary (which mask his real delight. Does the world really need another lawyer or investment banker? He wonders.) One dog: a standard poodle that seems to only enjoy barking and eating and sleeping, with an emphasis on the latter two. He used to be an avid runner, but now merely lurches and staggers a daily five miles. His only real hobby is fly fishing, which he considers himself to be fairly adept at —which means he occasionally encounters a fish stupid enough to be tricked by some feathers. <br><br>And, if you really want to know why he hates middle age it is this: When you are young, the adventures you have, that inform the words you write and the words you will write, are real and palpable. As you get older, they become farther apart – and one must rely increasingly on their imagination and their memory of things observed in the past. Nothing actually wrong with that of course: It’s just not nearly as much fun.</p>
<img src="http://www.johnkatzenbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/jk2.jpg" alt="Author Photo" id="img-three">
<p>On Dogs and Years, not Dog-years. <br><br>Now that I am getting a lot closer to the “end” of middle age, I should temper my criticisms of that time of life. It’s not so bad, considering the alternatives. Hate now seems a truly foolish choice of words. Tolerate might be better, especially when envy looms on the aging horizon. In an odd way, it seems to me that the best way to get older is to work harder at recovering those qualities that made being young work so wondrously. This simple observation, I suspect, is one that comes as revelation to some, and is a cliché and a truism to others. Sigh. <br><br>If this were a Hollywood movie, we would have to add in some thunderous orchestral blast to accompany these thoughts in order to give them sufficient gravitas and underscore the drama.
Now there’s an idea: for so much of our lives, we duck and avoid intensity, relying on routine and preferring what we imagine is normalcy. But, in truth the moments that become most memorable are those where the stakes are heightened. This is just as true for a novel as it is for day-to-day life. The older I get, the more I think the bard was absolutely right: all the world is a stage, and we are all players on it. <br><br>Of course, disagreeing with Shakespeare is probably an unwise course of behavior for any scribbler.</p>`;

<p class="bio">Gillian Flynn, in full Gillian Schieber Flynn American writer known for her darkly entertaining tales of murder and deceit in the Midwest. Flynn, the younger of two children, was raised in Kansas City, where both of her parents taught. She attended the University of Kansas, graduating (1994) with a bachelor’s degree in English and journalism. Following a two-year stint at a trade magazine in Los Angeles, Flynn attended Northwestern University, graduating (1997) from the Medill School of Journalism with a master’s degree. Though she initially intended to become a crime reporter, Flynn found herself unsuited to the intrusive nature of the job and instead worked as a stringer for the periodical U.S. News & World Report before accepting a position as a staff writer for Entertainment Weekly magazine. For the latter publication she reported from film sets and eventually became a television critic. Austerity cuts in 2008 led to the termination of her position, however, and she turned to fiction writing full-time.<br><br>Prior to being laid off, Flynn had already written Sharp Objects (2006; TV series 2018) and Dark Places (2009; film 2015), both mysteries set in the Midwest. Sharp Objects concerns a newspaper reporter who returns to her Missouri hometown to investigate a series of murders of young girls. The narrative, threaded with themes of child abuse and self-harm, was noted for its subtle evocation of dread. Dark Places centres on a young woman whose brother was convicted of her family’s brutal murder and on her efforts, decades later, to discern what really happened.<br><br></p>
<img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/75/187875-050-EDF182F9/Gillian-Flynn-American.jpg" alt="Author Photo" id="img-two">
<p>Gone Girl (2012) similarly investigated small-town malaise and menace. Its subtly creepy exploration of a fractured marriage in the wake of the wife’s disappearance and the subsequent suspicion cast on her husband won plaudits from many critics, who praised Flynn’s brisk pacing and her brutally unflinching view of human evil. The book became a best seller, and Flynn sold the movie rights for $1.5 million. The film version—penned by Flynn, directed by David Fincher, and starring Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike—was a box-office hit and earned Flynn a 2014 Golden Globe nomination for best adapted screenplay. Flynn later had an active role in adapting Sharp Objects into a TV series starring Amy Adams that aired in 2018. That same year Flynn cowrote the screenplay for Widows with director Steve McQueen. The movie received wide acclaim for transcending the heist genre to offer a complex narrative of race, class, and gender. She then created and cowrote the television series Utopia (2020), which centres on a group of comic-book fans trying to save the world; it was adapted from a British show.
Although some readers characterized Flynn’s work as misogynistic, Flynn countered that she was a feminist and that her characters simply demonstrated that malice and violence were not the sole preserve of men. <br><br></p>`;

<li class="name-author"><strong>Name:</strong> Agatha Christie</li>
<li class="born"><strong>Born:</strong> September 15, 1890 – January 12, 1976</li>
<img src="https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/9lCQnvNhkcAA6y1bIXsJndXBdlM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GettyImages-515355076-b3eb2fd4abc749d2937cd2872d16a3e9.jpg" alt="author photo" id="img-one">
<p class="bio">Agatha Christie was an English mystery author. After working as a nurse during World War I, she became a successful writer, thanks to her Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple mystery series. Christie is the best-selling novelist of all time, as well as the most-translated individual author of all time. <br><br>Early Life
Agatha Christie was the youngest of three children born to Frederick Alvah Miller and his wife, Clara Boehmer, a well-off upper-middle-class couple. Miller was the American-born son of a dry goods merchant whose second wife, Margaret, was Boehmer’s aunt. They settled in Torquay, Devon, and had two children before Agatha. Their oldest child, a daughter named Madge (short for Margaret) was born in 1879, and their son, Louis (who went by “Monty”), was born in Morristown, New Jersey, during an 1880 visit to the United States. Agatha, like her sister, was born in Torquay, ten years after her brother.
By most accounts, Christie’s childhood was a happy and fulfilling one. Along with her immediate family, she spent time with Margaret Miller (her mother’s aunt/father’s stepmother) and her maternal grandmother, Mary Boehmer. The family held an eclectic set of beliefs—including the idea that Christie’s mother Clara had psychic abilities—and Christie herself was homeschooled, with her parents teaching her reading, writing, math, and music. Although Christie’s mother wanted to wait until she was eight to begin teaching her to read, Christie essentially taught herself to read much earlier and became a passionate reader from a very young age. Her favorites included the work of children’s authors Edith Nesbit and Mrs. Molesworth, and, later, Lewis Carroll.
Because of her homeschooling, Christie didn’t have as much of an opportunity to form close friendships with other children in the first decade of her life. In 1901, her father died from chronic kidney disease and pneumonia after being in failing health for some time. The following year, she was sent to a regular school for the first time. Christie was enrolled at Miss Guyer's Girls' School in Torquay, but after years of a less-structured educational atmosphere at home, she found it hard to adjust. She was sent to Paris in 1905, where she attended a series of boarding and finishing schools.<br><br>Travel, Marriage, and World War I Experience <br><br>
Christie returned to England in 1910, and, with her mother’s health failing, decided to move to Cairo in hopes that a warmer climate might help her health. She visited monuments and attended social events; the ancient world and archaeology would play a role in some of her later writings. Eventually, they returned to England, just as Europe was drawing nearer to a full-scale conflict.
As an apparently popular and charming young woman, Christie’s social and romantic life expanded considerably. She reportedly had several short-lived romances, as well as an engagement that was soon called off. In 1913, she met Archibald “Archie” Christie at a dance. He was the son of a lawyer in the Indian Civil Service and an army officer who eventually joined the Royal Flying Corps. They fell in love quickly and married on Christmas Eve, 1914.<br><br> </p>
<img src="https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/JmEo56twP3U2bQZXwHOG5Pw1XCg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GettyImages-3171800-2f29dc73988147bebcd8c4b2e91cb42e.jpg" alt="Author Photo" id="img-two">
<p>World War I had begun a few months before their marriage, and Archie was sent to France. In fact, their wedding took place when he was home on leave after being away for months. While he was serving in France, Christie worked back at home as a member of the Voluntary Aid Detachment. She worked for over 3,400 hours at the Red Cross hospital in Torquay, first as a nurse, then as a dispenser once she qualified as an apothecary’s assistant. During this time, she encountered refugees, particularly Belgians, and those experiences would stay with her and inspire some of her early writing, including her famous Poirot novels.
Fortunately for the young couple, Archie survived his stint abroad and actually rose through the military ranks. In 1918, he was sent back to England as a colonel in the Air Ministry, and Christie ceased her VAD work. They settled in Westminster, and after the war, her husband left the military and began working in London’s financial world. The Christies welcomed their first child, Rosalind Margaret Clarissa Christie, in August 1919. <br><br>Before the war, Christie wrote her first novel, Snow Upon the Desert, set in Cairo. The novel was summarily rejected by all the publishers she sent it to, but writer Eden Philpotts, a family friend, put her in touch with his agent, who rejected Snow Upon the Desert but encouraged her to write a new novel. During this time, Christie also wrote a handful of short stories, including “The House of Beauty,” “The Call of Wings,” and “The Little Lonely God.” These early stories, which were written early in her career but not published until decades later, were all submitted (and rejected) under various pseudonyms. <br><br>
As a reader, Christie had been a fan of detective novels for some time, including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes stories. In 1916, she began working on her first mystery novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles. It was not published until 1920, after several failed submissions and, eventually, a publishing contract that required her to change the ending of the novel and that she later called exploitative. The novel was the first appearance of what would become one of her most iconic characters: Hercule Poirot, a former Belgian police officer who had fled to England when Germany invaded Belgium. Her experiences working with Belgian refugees during the war inspired the creation of this character. <br><br>
Over the next few years, Christie wrote more mystery novels, including a continuation of the Poirot series. In fact, over the course of her career, she would write 33 novels and 54 short stories featuring the character. In between working on the popular Poirot novels, Christie also published a different mystery novel in 1922, titled The Secret Adversary, which introduced a lesser-known character duo, Tommy and Tuppence. She also wrote short stories, many on commission from Sketch magazine. <br><br></p>
<img src="https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/QAm3FiByzJq5LS7tva8KvQYfx8U=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GettyImages-3207367-0e08e66dc60d4d92b860b768af2ae06a.jpg" alt="Author Photo" id="img-three">
<p>It was in 1926 that the strangest moment in Christie’s life occurred: her infamous brief disappearance. That year, her husband asked for a divorce and revealed he’d fallen in love with a woman named Nancy Neele. On the evening of December 3, Christie and her husband argued, and she disappeared that night. After nearly two weeks of public furor and confusion, she was found at the Swan Hydropathic Hotel on December 11, then left for her sister’s home soon after. Christie’s autobiography ignores this incident, and to this day, the actual reasons for her disappearance remain unknown. At the time, the public largely suspected that it was either a publicity stunt or an attempt to frame her husband, but the real reasons remain forever unknown and the subject of much speculation and debate. <br><br>In 1932, Christie published the short story collection The Thirteen Problems. In it, she introduced the character of Miss Jane Marple, a sharp-witted elderly spinster (who was somewhat based on Christie’s great-aunt Margaret Miller) who became another of her iconic characters. Although Miss Marple would not take off quite as quickly as Poirot did, she was eventually featured in 12 novels and 20 short stories; Christie reputedly preferred writing about Marple, but wrote more Poirot stories to meet public demand. <br>
The following year, Christie filed for divorce, which was finalized in October 1928. While her now-ex husband almost immediately married his mistress, Christie left England for the Middle East, where she befriended archaeologist Leonard Woolley and his wife Katharine, who invited her along on their expeditions. In February 1930, she met Max Edgar Lucien Mallowan, a young archaeologist 13 years her junior who took her and her group on a tour of his expedition site in Iraq. The two fell in love quickly and married just seven months later in September 1930. <br><br>Christie often accompanied her husband on his expeditions, and the locations they visited frequently provided inspiration or a setting for her stories. During the 1930s, Christie published some of her best-known works, including her 1934 Poirot novel Murder on the Orient Express. In 1939, she published And Then There Were None, which remains, to this day, the best-selling mystery novel in the world. Christie later adapted her own novel for the stage in 1943. <br><br>The breakout of World War II did not stop Christie from writing, although she split her time working at a pharmacy at University College Hospital in London. As a matter of fact, her pharmacy work ended up benefitting her writing, as she learned more about chemical compounds and poisons that she was able to use in her novels. Her 1941 novel N or M? briefly placed Christie under suspicion from MI5 because she named a character Major Bletchley, the same name as a top-secret codebreaking operation’s location. As it turned out, she had simply been stuck nearby on a train and, in frustration, gave the place’s name to an unlikeable character. During the war, she also wrote Curtains and Sleeping Murder, intended as the last novels for Poirot and Miss Marple, but the manuscripts were sealed away until the end of her life.
Christie continued writing prolifically in the decades after the war. By the late 1950s, she was reportedly earning around ₤100,000 per year. This era included one of her most famous plays, The Mousetrap, which famously features a twist ending (subverting the usual formula found in most of Christie’s works) that audiences are asked to not reveal when they leave the theater. It is the longest-running play in history and has been running continuously on the West End in London since its debut in 1952. <br><br>Christie continued writing her Poirot novels, despite growing increasingly tired of the character. Despite her personal feelings, though, she, unlike fellow mystery writer Arthur Conan Doyle, refused to kill off the character because of how beloved he was by the public. However, 1969’s Hallowe’en Party marked her final Poirot novel (although he did appear in short stories for a few more years) aside from Curtains, which was published in 1975 as her health declined and it became increasingly likely that she would write no more novels.</p>`;

<p>Although du Maurier is classed as a romantic novelist, her stories have been described as "moody and resonant" with overtones of the paranormal. Her bestselling works were not at first taken seriously by critics, but they have since earned an enduring reputation for narrative craft. Many have been successfully adapted into films, including the novels Rebecca, Frenchman's Creek, My Cousin Rachel and Jamaica Inn, and the short stories "The Birds" and "Don't Look Now". Du Maurier spent much of her life in Cornwall, where most of her works are set. As her fame increased, she became more reclusive. <br><br>Daphne du Maurier was born at 24 Cumberland Terrace, Regent's Park, London, the middle of three daughters of prominent actor-manager Sir Gerald du Maurier and actress Muriel Beaumont.[3] Her paternal grandfather was author and Punch cartoonist George du Maurier, who created the character of Svengali in the 1894 novel Trilby. Her paternal uncle Guy du Maurier was a playwright. Her mother was a paternal niece of journalist, author, and lecturer Comyns Beaumont.[4] Her elder sister, Angela du Maurier, became an actress and later also a writer, and her younger sister Jeanne was a painter.[5] She was also a cousin of the Llewelyn Davies boys, who served as J. M. Barrie's inspiration for the characters in the play Peter Pan; or, The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up.
As a young child, du Maurier met many prominent theatre actors, thanks to the celebrity of her father. On meeting Tallulah Bankhead, du Maurier was quoted as saying that Bankhead was the most beautiful creature she had ever seen.[6]
Du Maurier spent her childhood at Cannon Hall, Hampstead, the family's London residence, and summers at their home in Fowey, Cornwall, where they also lived during the war years. </p>`;

<li class="name-author"><strong>Name:</strong> Harlan Coben</li>
<li class="born"><strong>Born:</strong> January 4, 1962</li>
<img src="https://www.harlancoben.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/harlanauthorphotofinal_PhotocreditClaudioMarinescoresized-200x300.jpg" alt="author photo" id="img-one">
<p class="bio">Harlan Coben is an American writer of mystery novels and thrillers. The plots of his novels often involve the resurfacing of unresolved or misinterpreted events in the past, murders, or fatal accidents and have multiple twists. Among his novels are two series, each involving the same protagonist set in and around New York and New Jersey; some characters appear in both.
Coben has won an Edgar Award, a Shamus Award, and an Anthony Award—the first author to receive all three.His books have been translated into 43 different languages and sold over 60 million copies. Harlan is the creator and executive producer of several Netflix television dramas including STAY CLOSE, THE STRANGER, SAFE, THE FIVE, THE INNOCENT and THE WOODS. Harlan was also showrunner and executive producer for two French TV mini-series, UNE CHANCE DE TROP (NO SECOND CHANCE) and JUST UN REGARD (JUST ONE LOOK). KEINE ZWEIT CHANCE, also based on Harlan’s novel, aired in Germany on Sat1.
Harlan’s novel TELL NO ONE (NE LE DIS A PERSONNE) was turned into the renowned French film, directed by Guillaume Canet and starring Francois Cluzet. The movie was the top box office foreign-language film of the year in USA, won the Lumiere (French Golden Globe) for best picture and was nominated for nine Cesars (French Oscar) and won four, including best actor, best director and best music.
Winner of the Edgar Award, Shamus Award and Anthony Award – the first author to win all three – international bestselling author Harlan Coben’s critically-acclaimed novels have been called “ingenious” (New York Times), “poignant and insightful” (Los Angeles Times), “consistently entertaining” (Houston Chronicle), “superb” (Chicago Tribune) and “must reading” (Philadelphia Inquirer).<br><br> </p>

<p>In his first books, Coben immersed himself in the exploits of sports agent Myron Bolitar. Critics loved the series, saying, “You race to turn pages…both suspenseful and often surprisingly funny” (People). After seven books Coben wanted to try something different. “I came up with a great idea that simply would not work for Myron,” says Coben. The result was the critically acclaimed New York Times bestseller TELL NO ONE, which became the most decorated thriller of the year. Two books later, Bookspan, recognizing Coben’s broad international appeal, named NO SECOND CHANCE its first ever International Book of the Month in 2003 – the Main Selection in 15 different countries.
Harlan was the first writer in more than a decade to be invited to write fiction for the NEW YORK TIMES op-ed page. His Father’s Day short story, THE KEY TO MY FATHER, appeared June 15, 2003. His essays and columns have appeared in many top publications including the New York Times, Parade Magazine and Bloomberg Views.
Harlan has received an eclectic variety of honors from all over the world. In Paris, he was awarded the prestigious Vermeil Medal of Honor for contributions to culture and society by the Mayor of Paris. He was won the El Premio del Novela Negra RBA in Spain, the Grand Prix de Lectrices in France, and the CWA/ITV3 Bestseller Dagger for favorite crime novelist in England. On the other end of the spectrum, Little League Baseball inducted Harlan into their Hall of Excellence in 2013, and Harlan is also a member of the New England Basketball Hall of Fame from his playing days at Amherst College.
Harlan was born in Newark, New Jersey. He still lives in New Jersey with his wife, Anne Armstrong-Coben MD, a pediatrician, and their four children.</p>`;

<img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.pPrCxnq_aAiwa9oDJ-4b_gHaFA?pid=ImgDet&rs=1" alt="author photo" id="img-one">
<p class="bio"><br><br>Stephen King was graduated from the University of Maine and later worked as a teacher while establishing himself as a writer. Having also published work under the pseudonym Richard Bachman, King's first horror novel, Carrie, was a huge success. Over the years, King has become known for titles that are both commercially successful and sometimes critically acclaimed. His books have sold more than 350 million copies worldwide and been adapted into numerous successful films.<br><br><strong>Life and Education</strong><br><br>
Stephen Edwin King is recognized as one of the most famous and successful horror writers of all time. His parents, Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King, split up when he was very young, and he and his brother David divided their time between Indiana and Connecticut for several years. King later moved back to Maine with his mother and brother. There he graduated from Lisbon Falls High School in 1966. <br>King stayed close to home for college, attending the University of Maine at Orono. There he wrote for the school's newspaper and served in its student government. While in school, King published his first short story, which appeared in Startling Mystery Stories. After graduating with a degree in English in 1970, he tried to find a position as a teacher but had no luck at first. King took a job in a laundry and continued to write stories in his spare time until late 1971, when he began working as an English educator at Hampden Academy. It was that year that he also married fellow writer Tabitha Spruce. </p>

<p><br><strong>King of Thrills and Chills</strong><br><br>
In 1973, King sold his first novel, Carrie, the tale of a tormented teen who gets revenge on her peers. The book became a huge success after it was published the following year, allowing him to devote himself to writing full time. It was later adapted for the big screen with Sissy Spacek as the title character. More popular novels soon followed, including Salem's Lot (1975), The Shining (1977), Firestarter (1980), Cujo (1981) and IT (1986).While making novels about vicious, rabid dogs and sewer-dwelling monsters — as seen in Cujo and IT, respectively — King published several books as Richard Bachman. Four early novels — Rage (1977), The Long Walk (1979), Roadwork (1981) and The Running Man (1982) — were published under the moniker because of King's concern that the public wouldn't accept more than one book from an author within a year. He came up with the alias after seeing a novel by Richard Stark on his desk (actually a pseudonym used by Donald Westlake) coupled with what he heard playing on his record player at the time — "You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet," by Bachman Turner Overdrive.</p>`;

<p class="bio"><br><br>Alex was born on the small Mediterranean island of Cyprus, to an English mother and a Greek-Cypriot father. He was fortunate enough to grow up in a house full of books. His mother amassed a small library and all the authors who later influenced him as a writer – Charles Dickens, Evelyn Waugh, Angela Carter, Margaret Atwood, Robert Graves, Henry James – were taken off the shelves and handed to him by his mother with the instruction ‘to read’. (An action she possibly regretted when he became a struggling writer!)<br><br>But ironically his first and most profound reading experience had nothing to do with his mother.  She was perhaps a bit of a literary snob and didn’t read crime fiction – but his older sister did, and Alex snuck into her room when he was about eleven or twelve, and looked at the books on her shelf.  He was immediately attracted by her selection of Agatha Christie novels, mainly intrigued by the lurid covers, and chose And Then There Were None to read.  He devoured it in a state of excitement and fear and didn’t sleep all night.  He was probably scarred for life – and all he wanted was more.  The next summer at the beach, he read nothing but Agatha Christie – these were the first adult books he ever read – and that summer, sitting by the sea, reading, wriggling his toes in the sand, are among his happiest memories.</p>

<p><br>Agatha Christie made him into a reader – and a writer.  There is something about the structure of a whodunnit - crime, investigation, and final twist - that remains so satisfying to him, so beautiful.  As P.D. James said, a mystery brings order from disorder.  He always knew he wanted to write a book – and that it had to be that kind of book – a psychological detective story is how he thinks of The Silent Patient.  But mainly it must be said, when he eventually did write a novel, it was an attempt to replicate that first magical reading experience on the beach when he was a kid. He lived in Nicosia, Cyprus until the age of eighteen.  Greek culture, in particularly Ancient tragedy and mythology, has been a big influence on Alex.  The Greek myths are very much part of the culture in Cyprus. The tragedies are performed every summer, and Homer and the Greek tragedians are taught at school, in the way Shakespeare is taught in the UK or the US.  And he remains very grateful to his place of birth and education, as it meant he was given a whole mythological world in which to dwell as a writer.  The Greek myths are violent and magical and powerful; they are timeless stories about passion and heartbreak, love and loss. </p>`;

<li class="name-author"><strong>Name: </strong>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</li>
<li class="born"><strong>Born: </strong>May 22, 1859 - July 7, 1930</li>
<img src="https://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/images/sir-arthur-conan-doyle-17.jpg" alt="author photo" id="img-one">
<p class="bio"><br><br>Arthur Conan Doyle, in full Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle, (born May 22, 1859, Edinburgh, Scotland—died July 7, 1930, Crowborough, Sussex, England), Scottish writer best known for his creation of the detective Sherlock Holmes—one of the most vivid and enduring characters in English fiction.
Conan Doyle, the second of Charles Altamont and Mary Foley Doyle’s 10 children, began seven years of Jesuit education in Lancashire, England, in 1868. After an additional year of schooling in Feldkirch, Austria, Conan Doyle returned to Edinburgh. Through the influence of Dr. Bryan Charles Waller, his mother’s lodger, he prepared for entry into the University of Edinburgh’s Medical School. He received Bachelor of Medicine and Master of Surgery qualifications from Edinburgh in 1881 and an M.D. in 1885 upon completing his thesis, “An Essay upon the Vasomotor Changes in Tabes Dorsalis. While a medical student, Conan Doyle was deeply impressed by the skill of his professor, Dr. Joseph Bell, in observing the most minute detail regarding a patient’s condition. This master of diagnostic deduction became the model for Conan Doyle’s literary creation, Sherlock Holmes, who first appeared in A Study in Scarlet, a novel-length story published in Beeton’s Christmas Annual of 1887. Other aspects of Conan Doyle’s medical education and experiences appear in his semiautobiographical novels, The Firm of Girdlestone (1890) and The Stark Munro Letters (1895), and in the collection of medical short stories Round the Red Lamp (1894). (See also Sherlock Holmes: Pioneer in Forensic Science.) Conan Doyle’s creation of the logical, cold, calculating Holmes, the “world’s first and only consulting detective,” sharply contrasted with the paranormal beliefs Conan Doyle addressed in a short novel of this period, The Mystery of Cloomber (1889). Conan Doyle’s early interest in both scientifically supportable evidence and certain paranormal phenomena exemplified the complex diametrically opposing beliefs he struggled with throughout his life.<br><br></p>

Conan Doyle’s early interest in both scientifically supportable evidence and certain paranormal phenomena exemplified the complex diametrically opposing beliefs he struggled with throughout his life.Conan Doyle himself viewed his most important efforts to be his campaign in support of spiritualism, the religion and psychic research subject based upon the belief that spirits of the departed continued to exist in the hereafter and can be contacted by those still living. He donated the majority of his literary efforts and profits later in his life to this campaign, beginning with The New Revelation (1918) and The Vital Message (1919). He later chronicled his travels in supporting the spiritualist cause in The Wanderings of a Spiritualist (1921), Our American Adventure (1923), Our Second American Adventure (1924), and Our African Winter (1929). He discussed other spiritualist issues in his Case for Spirit Photography (1922), Pheneas Speaks (1927), and a two-volume The History of Spiritualism (1926). Conan Doyle became the world’s most-renowned proponent of spiritualism, but he faced considerable opposition for his conviction from the magician Harry Houdini and in a 1920 debate with the humanist Joseph McCabe. Even spiritualists joined in criticizing Conan Doyle’s article “The Evidence for Fairies,” published in The Strand Magazine in 1921, and his subsequent book The Coming of the Fairies (1922), in which he voiced support for the claim that two young girls, Elsie Wright and Frances Griffiths, had photographed actual fairies that they had seen in the Yorkshire village of Cottingley.</p>`;

<p class="bio"><br><br>Harris was born on April 11, 1940, in Jackson, Tennessee, but grew up in Rich, Mississippi as his family moved there. As a child he was introverted and spent most of his time reading. However, in high school he had grown out of the recluse phase. He studied at the same school his mother taught at, Clarksdale High School. His mother claimed that he was an avid reader and writer. He was highly inspired by Hemingway’s work. After graduating from high school, Harris opted for majors in English from Baylor University in Waco and earned his degree in 1964. He served as a reporter for a local newspaper, the Waco Tribune-Herald. His job was to cover the police beat. However, he found the work dull and unappealing. He penned a number of gothic stories for magazines, such as Argosy and True.<br><br>After graduating, Harris traveled Europe for a time. Back in the USA, he worked for the Associated Press out of New York. Not coincidentally, his duties for the press included covering murders and other crimes. This helped fuel his imagination in the fictional world, and he began to write macabre stories for magazines that began to show his attention for detail that would make his subsequent novels so popular.
In 1975, he wrote his first novel, Black Sunday, about a diabolical plot to kill thousands with a blimp during the Superbowl. Perhaps ahead of his time, the terrorism of 11 September, 2001, led to many stadiums being turned into no-fly zones due to fears of a similar attack. The book was turned into a film -- Domingo negro (1977) -- a very short two years after being published. Following its success, he devoted his career entirely to fictional novelization. <br><br> </p>

<p>Thomas Harris has a fetish for research. Consequently, his next work of fiction did not appear until 1981. His second novel Red Dragon denotes a different era of anti-heroes in literature as he created his own version of Frankenstein’s monster, named Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Hannibal is an exceptional psychiatrist with a downside of being a psychopathic serial killer. The story revolves around Will Graham, an adroit criminal profiler who once caught Hannibal but after getting nearly killed, takes an early retirement.  He has been approached by FBI agent, Jack Crawford, to help them catch a serial killer nicknamed “The Tooth Fairy”. The killer targets random families and in order to stop him before he strikes again Graham consult’s with the expert on the subject himself, Hannibal. The instant success of the first book paved way for sequels in Hannibal series. The second novel was published in 1988, entitled The Silence of the Lambs. In this book FBI Special Agent Clarice Starling is introduced, who conducts a study on Hannibal Lecter on Jack Crawford’s request, though his real intention was to seek help on another case. The book earned huge praise and many accolades. In 1991, it had been adapted into a major motion picture starring Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Lecter. The movie turned out to be a blockbuster attaining several Academy Awards. Other books in the series include Hannibal (1999) and Hannibal Rising (2006). Recently Harris has written screenplay for Hannibal (2013) TV series that again succeeded to garner positive reviews.</p>`;

<p class="bio"><br><br>Dennis Lehane was graduated from a Catholic high school in Boston and, after two years at two different Boston-area colleges, attended Eckerd College in Florida, where he received his bachelor of arts degree in 1988. While at Eckerd, he considered himself a writer of gloomy short stories but tossed off a draft of a novel in three weeks “to entertain myself,” as he puts it.<br><br>Lehane then took on a variety of jobs—counselor for handicapped and abused children, limousine driver, and truck loader. During this period, A Drink Before the War was published, a heavily revised version of that first novel dashed off at Eckerd. While attending Florida International University on a fellowship, he produced a draft of what would become Mystic River as his master’s thesis. After graduating in 2001 with a master of fine arts degree, he returned to Boston, continuing to work at jobs he did not have to take home with him, leaving time for writing, his true passion.<br><br></p>

<p>Lehane's first novel, A Drink Before the War (1994), which introduced the recurring characters Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro, won the 1995 Shamus Award for Best First P.I. Novel. The fourth novel in the series, Gone, Baby, Gone, was adapted into a film of the same *le in 2007; it was directed by Ben Affleck and starred Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan as Kenzie and Gennaro. Commenting on the movie after a sneak peek, Lehane said, "I saw the movie and it's terrific, I wasn't gonna say anything if I didn't like it but it's really terrific." Reportedly, Lehane "has never wanted to write the screenplays for the films , because he says he has 'no desire to operate on my own child.'"
Lehane at a book signing in February 2009
Lehane's novel Mystic River was adapted into a film in 2003; also called Mystic River and directed by Clint Eastwood, it starred Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon. Lehane can be briefly seen waving from a car in the parade scene at the end of the film. The novel itself was a finalist for the PEN/Winship Award and won the Anthony Award and the Barry Award for Best Novel, the M*achusetts Book Award in Fiction, and France's Prix Mystère de la critique.
Lehane's first play, Coronado, debuted in New York in December 2005, produced by Invisible City Theater Company. The play had its regional premiere at American Stage in St. Petersburg in April 2006 and its Midwest premiere in the fall of 2007 with Steep Theatre Company in Chicago. Coronado is based on his acclaimed short story Until Gwen, which was originally published in The Atlantic Monthly and was selected for both The Best American Short Stories and The Best Mystery Short Stories of 2005.
Lehane described working on his historical novel, The Given Day, as "a five- or six-year project." the novel opens in 1918 and encomp*es the 1919 Boston Police Strike and its aftermath. According to Lehane, "The strike changed everything. It had a big effect on the unionization movement, and Prohibition came on the heels of that, then Calvin Coolidge promising to break the unions. That's all linked to what's going on now.". While Lehane's epic novel centers on the 1919 Boston police strike, it contains a national sweep and may be the first of a trilogy or perhaps a four-book series. Lehane called the novel his "great white whale" and said that when he finally finished it, he would "either write a sequel—or take a break from the cops and return to Patrick and Angie." The novel was published in October 2008.</p>`;

<p class="bio"><br><br>Tom Clancy became one of the best-selling writers of the late 20th and early 21st Centuries, starting with the publication of his 1984 thriller, The Hunt for Red October (1990). Born in Baltimore to a U.S. Post Office employee and his wife on April 12, 1947, Clancy graduated from Loyola Blakefield, a Catholic private high school, in 1965 and then attended Loyola College. After graduating with his bachelor's degree in English literature, Clancy went into the insurance business as poor eyesight kept him out of the military. Despite being unable to serve during the Vietnam War, military and Cold War politics remained close to his heart.
While running his own insurance agency in Maryland, he wrote "The Hunt for Red October", which was published by the Naval Institute Press in 1984. Clancy received the princely sum of $5,000 from this most unusual venue for a work of fiction, but the book struck a nerve in the depths of the latter stages of the Cold War. The hardcover from the Naval Institute sold 45,000 copies, an amazing amount for a first novel from a publishing house peddling its first book of fiction, but the paperback (boosted by a strong recommendation from President Ronald Reagan) sold two million copies.<br><br></p>

<p>The book was very detailed and extremely savvy when it came to the machinations of the military and Cold War politicians. In fact, Clancy's editor at the Naval Institute Press had him eliminate details, which trimmed the novel by 100 pages. In all, he wrote 28 books, mostly fiction but also, military themed non-fiction books. Clancy placed 17 books on the New York Times Best Seller List, many of which hit #1. His oeuvre accounted for sales of 100 million copies, making him one of the all-time most popular writers in history.
Clancy became a media industry onto himself. He was successful lending his name and ideas to video games, and his video game company Red Storm Entertainment was bought out for $45 million in 2000. Clancy-branded video games racked up sales of 76 million units. Movies adapted from Clancy's works racked up $786.5 million at the box office.</p>`;

In her later 30s, her p*ion for writing was unexpectedly rekindled. She began writing her debut novel in the months-long lulls between castings;In the Woods was published in 2007 to much international acclaim and received rave reviews from many publications. Publishers Weekly praised French, saying she "expertly walks the line between police procedural and psychological thriller in her debut" and that "Ryan and Maddox are empathetic and flawed heroes, whose partnership and friendship elevate the narrative beyond a gory tale of murdered children and repressed childhood trauma." It received several literary prizes, was a bestseller in hardcover and paperback, and has been termed a 'dream debut'. As of 2015 more than one million copies of In the Woods have been sold. Flavorwire, in 2014, included it in their 50 of the Greatest Debut Novels Since 1950.
The second novel, The Likeness (2008), presents the story of the debut novel's co-lead, C*ie Maddox. It quickly achieved high positions on bestseller lists in various countries and stayed on The New York Times Best Seller list for several months. In its reviews of the novel, Kirkus praised its mix of "police procedures, psychological thrills and gothic romance beautifully woven into one stunning story". In an interview with The Guardian, French revealed that Donna Tartt's The Secret History was a source of influence on The Likeness, opening up the "landscape of friendship as something worthy of exploration and something that could be powerful enough to trigger a murder."
The first six novels are part of the Dublin Murder Squad series, but don't necessarily have to be read in order. After publishing The Tresp*er in 2016, Tana French published two standalone novels. Both The Witch Elm and The Searcher also take place in Ireland.</p>`;

<p class="bio"><br><br>An aggressive and outspoken Republican, Paula Hawkins sailed into office in a Republican sweep led by victorious presidential candidate Ronald Reagan in 1980. A staunch defender of her ever-changing Florida constituency, she also created a public dialogue on the subject of missing, exploited, and abused children. Hawkins’s vigorous work to pass the 1982 Missing Children’s Act helped bring to light a long-ignored national scourge.
Paula Fickes was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, on January 24, 1927, the oldest of three children raised by Paul, a chief warrant officer in the Navy, and Leone (Staley) Fickes. In 1934 the family settled in Atlanta, Georgia, where Paul Fickes took a teaching job at Georgia Tech. The Fickes eventually separated, and Leone Fickes moved with her children to Logan, Utah. Paula Fickes graduated from Cache High School in Richmond, Utah, in 1944. She attended Utah State University before taking a job as a secretary for the university’s director of athletics. Paula Fickes married Walter Eugene Hawkins on September 5, 1947. The couple settled in Atlanta, where Walter studied electrical engineering; he later owned a successful electronics business. The Hawkins raised three children: Genean, Kevin, and Kelly Ann.<br><br></p>

<p>The family moved to Florida in 1955 where Paula Hawkins first entered public affairs as a community activist and volunteer for the local Republican Party organization. In 1966, she helped orchestrate Republican Edward John Gurney’s successful campaign in the GOP primary and general election for a House seat. Two years later, Hawkins co-chaired the Richard M. Nixon presidential campaign in Florida. Hawkins’s work as a GOP regular provided her the base from which to launch a political career, winning election to the Florida public service commission where she served from 1972 to 1979. In 1974 she entered the primary race for the U.S. Senate seat held by Gurney, then a freshman incumbent under investigation for campaign finance improprieties.1 Hawkins, however, failed to secure the GOP nomination. In 1978 Hawkins lost a campaign for lieutenant governor of Florida.
In 1980, encouraged by the Republican National Committee, Hawkins entered the race for the seat of incumbent Democrat Senator Richard Bernard Stone. She won a plurality against five other contenders in the GOP primary but fell short of the necessary majority by just a few points. In the runoff primary she overwhelmed the runner-up, former U.S. Representative Louis Frey Jr. with 62 percent of the vote.2 In the general election, she faced popular former U.S. Representative William Dawson (Bill) Gunter Jr., who had edged Senator Stone in the Democratic primary. The election seemed to hinge less on substantive issues than on the candidates’ personalities, with Hawkins depicted, partly on her own volition, as being aggressive and forceful. “[Voters] don’t want specifics,” Hawkins said. “People are looking for somebody that will shake it up. . . .That’s all they want. They want a fighter.”3 Observers agreed that Hawkins benefited from the long coattails of GOP presidential candidate Ronald Reagan, who won Florida with 56 percent of the vote on his way to victory. Hawkins won, too, but by a narrower margin, just 52 percent.4 She was part of a Republican tide in the Senate, as 14 new GOP Senators were elected to the upper chamber, shifting control away from the Democrats for the first time in nearly three decades.
When Senator Stone resigned from office on December 31, 1980, Hawkins was appointed to fill his seat on January 1, 1981, thus giving her a minor seniority advantage over the rest of the Senate freshmen who were sworn in two days later. Senator Hawkins was assigned to three committees when the 97th Congress (1981–1983) convened: Labor and Human Resources; Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; and Joint Economic. In the 98th Congress (1983–1985), she received additional appointments to the Foreign Relations Committee and the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. Hawkins also served on the Special Committee on Aging.</p>`;
