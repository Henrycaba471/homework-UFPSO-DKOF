                <li class="born"><strong>Born: </strong>August 26, 1972</li>

                <p class="bio"><br><br>An aggressive and outspoken Republican, Paula Hawkins sailed into office in a Republican sweep led by victorious presidential candidate Ronald Reagan in 1980. A staunch defender of her ever-changing Florida constituency, she also created a public dialogue on the subject of missing, exploited, and abused children. Hawkins’s vigorous work to pass the 1982 Missing Children’s Act helped bring to light a long-ignored national scourge.
                Paula Fickes was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, on January 24, 1927, the oldest of three children raised by Paul, a chief warrant officer in the Navy, and Leone (Staley) Fickes. In 1934 the family settled in Atlanta, Georgia, where Paul Fickes took a teaching job at Georgia Tech. The Fickes eventually separated, and Leone Fickes moved with her children to Logan, Utah. Paula Fickes graduated from Cache High School in Richmond, Utah, in 1944. She attended Utah State University before taking a job as a secretary for the university’s director of athletics. Paula Fickes married Walter Eugene Hawkins on September 5, 1947. The couple settled in Atlanta, where Walter studied electrical engineering; he later owned a successful electronics business. The Hawkins raised three children: Genean, Kevin, and Kelly Ann.<br><br></p>

                <p>The family moved to Florida in 1955 where Paula Hawkins first entered public affairs as a community activist and volunteer for the local Republican Party organization. In 1966, she helped orchestrate Republican Edward John Gurney’s successful campaign in the GOP primary and general election for a House seat. Two years later, Hawkins co-chaired the Richard M. Nixon presidential campaign in Florida. Hawkins’s work as a GOP regular provided her the base from which to launch a political career, winning election to the Florida public service commission where she served from 1972 to 1979. In 1974 she entered the primary race for the U.S. Senate seat held by Gurney, then a freshman incumbent under investigation for campaign finance improprieties.1 Hawkins, however, failed to secure the GOP nomination. In 1978 Hawkins lost a campaign for lieutenant governor of Florida.
                In 1980, encouraged by the Republican National Committee, Hawkins entered the race for the seat of incumbent Democrat Senator Richard Bernard Stone. She won a plurality against five other contenders in the GOP primary but fell short of the necessary majority by just a few points. In the runoff primary she overwhelmed the runner-up, former U.S. Representative Louis Frey Jr. with 62 percent of the vote.2 In the general election, she faced popular former U.S. Representative William Dawson (Bill) Gunter Jr., who had edged Senator Stone in the Democratic primary. The election seemed to hinge less on substantive issues than on the candidates’ personalities, with Hawkins depicted, partly on her own volition, as being aggressive and forceful. “[Voters] don’t want specifics,” Hawkins said. “People are looking for somebody that will shake it up. . . .That’s all they want. They want a fighter.”3 Observers agreed that Hawkins benefited from the long coattails of GOP presidential candidate Ronald Reagan, who won Florida with 56 percent of the vote on his way to victory. Hawkins won, too, but by a narrower margin, just 52 percent.4 She was part of a Republican tide in the Senate, as 14 new GOP Senators were elected to the upper chamber, shifting control away from the Democrats for the first time in nearly three decades.
                When Senator Stone resigned from office on December 31, 1980, Hawkins was appointed to fill his seat on January 1, 1981, thus giving her a minor seniority advantage over the rest of the Senate freshmen who were sworn in two days later. Senator Hawkins was assigned to three committees when the 97th Congress (1981–1983) convened: Labor and Human Resources; Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; and Joint Economic. In the 98th Congress (1983–1985), she received additional appointments to the Foreign Relations Committee and the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. Hawkins also served on the Special Committee on Aging.</p>
